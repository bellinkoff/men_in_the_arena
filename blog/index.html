  <p class="large-10 large-offset-1 large-offset-right-1 columns" style="font-size: 20px; color: red;">I started to seed this with your Kickstarter posts, but stopped because it's clear that a lot of them are addressed to the backers and wouldn't make as much sense on the public-facing blog. Let me know if you want me to get rid of some or all of it. Of course, will take any other notes design or otherwise that you want. Could incorporate next/prev functionality so it only loads like...5-10 of the latest posts, but we can address that when that becomes an issue.</p>
