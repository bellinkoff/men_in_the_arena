Dear Backers,

On Friday, Kickstarter cleared access to your generous contributions, and we’re especially grateful given the week we have in front of us. Brian and I are heading to Dallas to film with Saadiq, while a cinematographer colleague, Dru, is heading into Mogadishu for a few days to do some filming with the other national team player we’re building the film around. We will share his name in the coming weeks but first we need to guarantee his safety and we're exploring options to try and do just that. For now we'll refer to him as Saadiq's friend.

Dru’s mission has many logistical challenges and security risks that we’ve been working to overcome for weeks. We need to get him to and from a farming town 30 km outside of Mogadishu in one day. It’s a journey Saadiq’s friend makes once a week, but it’s a dangerous passage. In fact, it’s the same road Al Shabaab attacked African Union peacekeeping forces on to retaliate for the US drone strike that killed the Al-Qaeda linked Al Shabaab leader, Ahmed Godane, back on Sept. 1.

In Oct. 2011, a month before Wold Cup regional qualifying, Saadiq's friend, was home helping his brother on their farm when he was captured by Al Shabaab for listening to music. He was thrown in a prison for seven days, malnourished and beaten until village elders negotiated his release. 

It’s because of this history with Al Shabaab and informants that may still lurk in the village that we have to find a balance between going in with a low profile while also managing Dru's safety. It's a very expensive trip but thanks to this campaign we can pay for the security and confidently go after some of the most important footage we need to share Saadiq's friend's story. 

It's going to be a great week! If you haven't already please join us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/meninthearena). 

Sincerely, 

J.R. Biersmith
