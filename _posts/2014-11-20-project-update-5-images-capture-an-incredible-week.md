**He Did It:** In our last update, LA & Nairobi based Cinematographer Andrew "Dru" Mungai was about to embark on a trip to Somalia, and we are thrilled to report he has returned safely. This is an image from 30km outside of Mogadishu where he made a brave trip to catch up with Saadiq's friend and family.

**First Rodeo:** Last week, Brian, Shane, and I flew to Dallas for five days to do some filming with Saadiq. Saadiq has been in America for over two months now and it was a thrill to see how well he's adjusting to life in Frisco, Texas. After a whirlwind couple of days, we decided to try and do something uniquely Texas and drove an hour south to the Fort Worth Stock Yards. Pictured (left to right): Saadiq, J.R., Shane, Liban, Brian, and the outpost cashier.

**BBC Outlook:** On Monday, one of our favorite storytelling platforms aired our interview about the film. It's an hour long show, but you can fast forward to the 13 minute mark to pick up [our interview](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02bggp9).
