Hello MITA Supporters,

Over the holidays, we did an interview for a weekly BBC Sports Radio program called Sportshour. The host serves up a really nice introduction at [this link](http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/worldservice/sport/sport_20150103-1200a.mp3) at 14:45. They also packaged the story separately (sans the introduction) for the web and social media [here](http://bbc.in/1sbYxbm%20%20).

We've made considerable strides over the past several weeks, and we are feeling encouraged by our first rough cut of the film.  We have a great deal of heavy lifting to do yet, but we'll get there. Thank you for your continued support. We'll be in touch!
