Filmmaker J.R. Biersmith spent a year following two friends who played for the national soccer team in Somalia. He's working on a documentary that will tell the story of their dream to one day play professionally - in the face of some steep odds.

It's a story, in part, about how and why soccer has survived in Somalia even while the country has been at war. Biersmith is just [wrapping up a Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/748917089/men-in-the-arena) campaign to fund the project.

Biersmith joins The Daily Circuit to talk about the Somali national team, the process of filming the documentary and what he learned along the way.
